# Resume Feedback App (Dynamic)

This is a Flask-based app that reads real content from uploaded PDF resumes and gives feedback on:

- Keyword usage
- Readability (basic sentence structure)
- Section presence (like Projects, Education, Objective)

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install flask PyPDF2
